# What you will need:
YOU WILL NEED DEVKITPRO INSTALLED TO COMPILE PROJECTS!
THE EDITOR UPON PRESSING COMPILE PROJECT WILL JUST OPEN A FOLDER IN FILE EXPLORER AND THEN YOU WILL NEED TO EXECUTE 'make' IN A CMD OR POWERSHELL PROCESS!

# What you will need to do:
To open this project use the open currenly opened scene button with the tscn scene open.

# This project shows off (more than) several things like:

Wav audio file playing support. (copied from https://github.com/CaptainSwag101/NAMELESS converted to c by ME!!)
 
T3s file auto generation with multiple folders acting as the spritesheets!
 
Groups for making things like but not limited to: Scenes, Wavespawns, Scripted sequences, GUI and more!!
 
no collisions. :( (SOON TO COME!)
 
Half-assed Parent/Child node system.
 
A WHOLE LOT OF TEMPLATE CONFIG RESOURCES. (most of them with variables tied to my games that I'm working on.)
 
Variables can be auto generated with the current node name by adding SELFOBJ inbetween, before and even after the name of the variable!
 
Same goes with Groups. They can be auto generated and referenced with GROUPENABLE Global variable!
 
Drawing and Singular Enable Variables.
 
Enumerators for TOP and BOTTOM screens.
 
Current spritesheet variable. (Will be automated soon!)
 
Global variables and groups with corrisponding defaults.
 
Extra Main functions.
 
Top and Bottom screen default colors.
 
Textures var does nothing.
